### Hi there, 
## I am a student pursuing a BS in Information Technology and Economics, with a minor in Applied Statistics using this platform of Github to share my projects and collaborate on some projects that interest me.
## As an aspiring data scientist, I am familiar with programming in Python and R for data analysis and Machine learning with libraries numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit. I also have knowledge on Statistics and Mathematics. 
I am also good with working in Excel for preliminary data preprocessing, analysis and financial accounting. Furthermore, I have experience in using Stata, and Google sheets.  
## I would love to use this platform to collaborate with other people who are interested in working in the field of data science.
